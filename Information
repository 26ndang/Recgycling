  <h2> What is recycling? </h2> 
  <p> Recycling is the process of breaking down different materials 
   like plastic, paper, glass, and metals to reuse them. This helps save our resources. Most things that people recycle are made 
   into new things and used over and over again, as bottles, cans, paper, and more. Recycling is good for your community and the environment.</p> 
</div>
 <div>
   <h2> Why is Recycling Important?</h2> 
    <p> Things that are not recyclable end up in the landfill. 
     This is bad because trash in landfills just sits there, letting off methane 
     gas while they very slowly break down. Methane gas makes the Greenhouse Gas layer in the atmosphere thicker and our planet hotter,
     and the other harmful gases it lets off harms the environment and the toxins pollute the air that we breathe 
     and the water that we drink. Lots of things we throw away to go in the landfill 
     can be recycled and saved from being wasted and turned into methane. The pollutants
     will be reduced if people recycle more. This also saves space for things that truly 
     cannot be repurposed. When we recycle, it also means that we are making less new products, because
     when using recycled resources, less new resources have to be made. </p>

    <h2> Recycling vs. Landfill </h2> 
      <p> Recycling breaks down materials to use again while items 
       in the landfill sit there and turn into harmful methane gases. Recycling is better 
       for the environment because it saves our natural resources and reduces the amount 
       of greenhouse gases in our air.</p>

   <h2> What makes things recyclable? </h2>
   <p>Technology has to exist to recycle that material, there has to 
    be a buyer, and the processor must fit into the economics</p>

   <h2> FUN FACTS </h2>
   <ol>
    <li> Did you know that styrofoam is mostly air? This is why people don't want to 
     make technology to recycle it-they don't think it's cost effective. </li> 
    <li> Did you know that you can't recycle a pizza box? Although it is made out of cardboard,
     the pizza grease on it makes it non-recyclable. Unless your pizza box has never had 
     pizza on it, (or has a protective piece of plastic or something), it is not recyclable, so don't
     make the mistake of recycling it.

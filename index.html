  <h2> What is recycling? </h2> 
  <p> Recycling is the process of breaking down different materials 
   like plastic, paper, glass, and metals to reuse them. This helps save our resources. Most things that people recycle are made 
   into new things and used over and over again, as bottles, cans, paper, and more. Recycling is good for your community and the environment.</p>

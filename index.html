<h1> Recycling </h1>

  <h2> What is recycling? </h2> 
  <p> Recycling is the process of breaking down different materials to reuse them. 
    This helps save our resources. Most things that people recycle are made into new 
    things and used over and over again.</p> 
  <body> <h2> Why is Recycling Important?</h2> 
    <p> Things that are not recyclable end up in the landfill. This is bad because trash in landfills just sits there, 
      letting off methane gas while they very slowly break down. Methane gas and the other harmful gases it lets off harms 
      the environment and the toxins pollute the air that we breathe and the water that we drink. Lots of things we throw away 
      to go in the landfill can be recycled and saved from being wasted and turned into methane. The pollutants will be reduced 
      if people recycle more. This also saves space for things that truly cannot be repurposed. </p> 
    <h2> Recycling vs. Landfill </h2> 
      <p> Recycling breaks down materials to use again while items in the landfill sit 
        there and turn into harmful methane gases. Recycling is better for the environment 
        because it saves our natural resources and reduces the amount of greenhouse gases in our air.</p>
   <h2> What makes things recyclable? </h2>
   <p>Technology has to exist to recycle that material, there has to be a buyer, and the processor must fit into the 
    economics</p>
